These are python programs meant to decode Hidden Markov Models of exon and intron states of genetic sequences. Currently, the viterbi method is implemented. 
Example Hidden Markov Models in the form of a .json can be found in the Data folder. The term "order" describes the length of sequences used in calculating the emmission probability. For example, an order of 1 would indicate emmission probabilities for sequences of length 2 (AA = .1, AG = .2, ...).
